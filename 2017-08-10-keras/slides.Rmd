## Supervised Learning

Given a dataset of input values $X$ and the corresponding outputs $y$, learn a generalizable
function $h(X)$.

DNNs are very effective at fitting non-linear $h(X)$ and achieve SOA on supervised machine learning tasks.

## MNIST

We are going to train a CNN (convolutional neural network) on a MNIST dataset containing labeled digits 0-9.

Goal: given a labeled training set, correctly classify new images as the corresponding digit.

What neural networks crave

## Tensorflow, Theano, and friends

## [Keras](https://keras.io/)

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

Originally developed by François Chollet to facilitate AI research, the guiding principles were simplicity and rapid prototyping.

_Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research._ (source: [Keras.io](Keras.io))

## What's in a name?

Keras (κέρας) means horn in Greek. It is a reference to a literary image from ancient Greek and Latin literature, first found in the Odyssey, where dream spirits (Oneiroi, singular Oneiros) are divided between those who deceive men with false visions, who arrive to Earth through a gate of ivory, and those who announce a future that will come to pass, who arrive through a gate of horn. It’s a play on the words κέρας (horn) / κραίνω (fulfill), and ἐλέφας (ivory) / ἐλεφαίρομαι (deceive).

Keras was initially developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System).

## Deep Learning in a Nutshell

## Models & Layers - the Zen of Keras
Simple feedforward network:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential()

from keras.layers import Dense, Activation

model.add(Dense(units=64, input_dim=100))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=10))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))

model.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,
              optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, 
                                             momentum=0.9,
                                             nesterov=True))
              
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)

classes = model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128)
```

## Keras and R

- Taylor Arnold's _kerasR_:

https://github.com/statsmaths/kerasR

- J.J. Allaire's _rstudio/keras_:

https://rstudio.github.io/keras/

Both rely on [_reticulate_](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate), R interface to Python.

## Option 1: Install kerasR

1. Install Anaconda
https://www.continuum.io/downloads

2. Create a new environment
https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html

```
conda create --name dlnn python=3.6 anaconda
```

3. Install TensorFlow (or Theano!)
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

Be sure to pick the GPU version if you have an NVIDIA card!

## Option 1 (continued): Install kerasR

In R:

4. Install _kerasR_ package (also _reticulate_)
```r
install.packages("kerasR")
```

5. Activate previously created Anaconda environment
```r
reticulate::use_condaenv("dlnn")
```

6. Test keras availability (should return TRUE)
```r
reticulate::py_module_available("keras")
```

## Option 2: Install rstudio/keras
1. Install Anaconda

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

In RStudio:

2. Install from GitHub (as of 08/17)

```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/keras")
```

3. Have RStudio handle keras installation

```r
library(keras)
install_keras(method = conda, tensorflow_gpu = FALSE) # TRUE for GPU
```
https://rstudio.github.io/keras/reference/install_keras.html

## Demo

## notMNIST

MNIST is a classic / clean dataset.

notMNIST is a more challenging dataset developed by Yaroslav Bulatov (Google Brain / OpenAI).

## Concluding remarks

Keras is great for rapid prototyping and learning!

When not to use Keras?

- non-standard / research neural nets
- need a good debugger (TF / PyTorch)
- need a dynamic computational graph (use PyTorch!)
